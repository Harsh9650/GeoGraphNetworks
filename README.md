GeoGraphNetworks: Great Britains Web of Roads and Rivers

The GeoGraphNetworks data repository offers a wide collection of road and river networks across Great Britain (GB), giving users a clear picture of the country’s infrastructure.
This dataset includes major highways and local roads, as well as rivers that flow through both cities and countryside. It allows researchers, urban planners, and anyone interested 
to explore how these networks connect people and places. With GeoGraphNetworks, you can easily analyze the travel routes and waterways that play a crucial role in 
Great Britain’s transportation system. The dataset is hosted on Figshare (https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/GeoGraphNetworks_Great_Britain_s_Web_of_Roads_Rivers/27284859), and this repository showcases the ESRI Shapefile view along with graphical representations of the created networks.
